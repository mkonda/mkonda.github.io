								<h2>Entrepreneurship | Being a Founder</h2>
								<p>I have been fortunate to walk a path toward building products, services and now companies.
									Of course, I can point to many successes and failures along the way.
								   I owe this to many people and expect to <a href="blog">write</a> about what I've learned.</p>

								<h2>Social Justice | Politics</h2>
								<p>I've had a passion for social justice since elementary school.  This photo
								   made a distinct impression ... what would I stand in front of a tank for?
								   My mother registered voters in Mississippi during the Civil Rights Movement.  
								   My father, a math professor at a women's college, tought me not to say girl.  
								   I'm in a cross cultural mixed race marriage and a number of folks in 
								   my family are gay and married.  Oh, and I'm an atheist.

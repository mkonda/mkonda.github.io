description: Don't Give Platforms the Power To Control What You Read

This is a post about how we can consciously consume information and
why that is so important.

I'm old enough to remember how "the internet" was going to bring
open endless possibilities because anyone could create content
or produce news or products ... it was such a hopeful moment that
also promised that new ideas could get a fresh chance against
established companies.  It meant change but also freedom.

The other day I was talking to a friend about posting on LinkedIn
(I had asked him to engage with a post I wrote) and he launched into a
tutorial on how you have to game the algorithm.  A key highlight
was:

>Don't link off site or the algorithm will down promote your post.
Make sure you engage with comments and then put links in the
comments instead of in your main post.

When he said this, it just hit me in the face (again) how much
we have ceded control of what we see and read to companies.  You
mean how much my posts gets seen are basically a function of how
much LinkedIn likes it and how much it promotes ongoing
engagement with their platform!?  It is obvious and everybody
knows - but do we do anything about it?

It is not just what we're reading though that we've ceded to
companies.  It's also what we write.  This has implications
we are just starting to understand with
ChatGPT and similar AI trained on our content!

What can we do?

1. Decide what to read.  Don't follow algorithms.
2. Distribute content on your own site.

We don't have to be perfect, but if everybody does it a little
bit we may start to make it so that these organizations don't
control everything we read.

## Be Conscious and Creative About Your Sources

To decide what to read, I use things like RSS readers to aggregate
updates across a wide variety of blogs to give myself a way to
see different content.

I also visit news sites directly (eg. NY Times, Economist) and
not through advertising platforms like Google, Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter (X), etc.

Fundamentally, we need to understand that the big companies that
we think of as social media companies or social networking
companies are really ADVERTISING companies.

If you find yourself scrolling - or on the same site for more
than a short time - you are probably being tricked into that.

## Own and Distribute Your Own Content

To maintain control of my content, I run my own content sites.
This is trivially easy with Github Pages or Wordpress.  That
doesn't stop the platforms from voting my promotional posts
up or down, but it does mean they can't take the content down.

I won't submit to the advertising platforms completely and
just put my content on their sites.  If your content is only on
Google, LinkedIn and Facebook (not to mention TikTok, Youtube,
Snap, Insta, Medium) you probably agreed that they own it.
Not only that, they can always adjust the algorithm to change
how you get seen.

Ultimately, this control of distribution is largely symbolic.
Unless everyone starts doing this another way, the platforms
will retain basic control over what people see and read.  But
we can be a little subversive and take this control back from
time to time.

## Conclusion

It takes more work not to just read what the platforms tell us.
It takes work to promote our content independently. But it is
worth it.

I recommend a few books around this topic as well:

* Stolen Focus - Johan Hari
* How To Do Nothing - Jenny Odell

After almost 13 years building and running Jemurai, I have entered a
definitive agreement to sell Jemurai to Crux Security which is run
by my friend and longtime Jemurai business partner Luke Barnes.

I chose this direction largely because it offered the best
continuity for my team and our customers, both of whom were the
most important reasons for doing Jemurai in the first place.

When I started, I set out to change the way developers engage with
security. I observed an adversarial mindset where often security
experts would look down on the security failings of developers.
I wanted developers to be seen as smart and give them tools to
address security more proactively and as a natural part of their
job.

In some ways we succeeded. In others, many of the same challenges
exist. I had to learn a lot about sales, marketing, finance, HR,
SaaS, consulting, management and more just to try to run the
business. In the end, I probably burned out a bit. The idea of
being able to focus on one problem area in a new place was
enticing.

As I reflect here, the most important thing I want to do is thank
everyone who supported me during this time, from our employees
(current and former) to our customers, to our network of supporters.
Thank you. It has been a privilege to have the space to work with
you in this independent way and I appreciate you all. I believe
we kept our promises and did great work along the way as well,
and that is also important.

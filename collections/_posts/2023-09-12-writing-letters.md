A couple of weeks ago I dropped my daughter at college.
It was a bittersweet moment.  On the one hand, she was
achieving everything we would have wanted for her and
growing into an excellent and independent young woman.
On the other, it was a big loss to have an empty seat
at the table - and to think of a major part of our
parenting journey transitioning to something a little
different.

As I tried to give her the space to meet people and
explore her new playground, I realized there was still
so much that I wanted to say ... and some of it included
things I wanted her to remember that I said.  Things
that didn't need to be communicated this second, but
this year.

I ended up buying some stationary and writing a letter.
*It felt great!*  I _think_ it was also appreciated,
though maybe the really powerful thing is in the long
game after the habit has kicked in and maybe we get in
the habit of writing to each other.

Since then, I have started writing letters to a lot
of people that are important to me.  Watch out, you
might get one!

I have written letters prolifically at various points.
First, when I was in Japan in 1987 and we didn't have email
or chat.  Then again when my future wife was on a semester
abroad.

I realized I love writing letters and it helps me
get my ideas out of my head and hopefully convey them to
other people in a medium that they can digest.  There's no
reason you can't do it in an email, but I think a lot of
people don't have time to really read email and do you
keep email and go back and read it to remember something
important someone said?  Sure, you can.  But do you?

I owe a nod to a few people including both my grandfather
and my brother who have very good writing habits.  Also,
my friend Reuben who puts pen to paper to write thank you
notes.  I laugh a bit when I think about the old school
mathemeticians and scientists who collaborated often
through very slow correspondence.

In a moment where every company wants to have your time,
bring you to their platform, use your content to better
advertise to you - I would argue writing letters on
paper and using the mail is downright subversive!

Anyway, I will be doing more of this and I'm excited
about it so I thought I would share. If you'd like to
get a letter, shoot me an email!  ;-)

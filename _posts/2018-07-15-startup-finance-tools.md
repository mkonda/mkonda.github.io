For me, finance was one of the areas that initially intimidated me about starting my own business.

It turns out, there are just a few basic tools you need.

* QuickBooks Online - We've had a number of accountants.  Don't let them talk you into the enterprise desktop version.  Use this for tracking everything and sync it to your actual accounts.
* We use JustWorks as a PEO.  This allows us to seamlessly ensure that our employee and contractor taxes get withheld.
* DryRun - Useful for modeling cash flow.
* Excel / Google Sheets - Turns out spreadsheets are where most of the interesting things happen.  Use these to create models, test scenarios, etc.
* Our bank has a "dropbox" service that we can have checks sent to that will automatically get deposited.  This is handy.  Not free ... but handy.

## Recent Reading

Recent books I've enjoyed:

1. The Way Music Works
2. The Invention of Nature
3. The Art of Strategy
4. The Shadow and Bone Series

I'm rereading Business Model Generation.

## Business Status

SPIO and Jemurai are both busy and growing.  Constant challenge is to balance
growth with revenue.  Seems like there is a challenge coming where we could
do a lot more if we had a bit more to spend on sales and marketing in particular.

Some focus on Traction and channels.

You might think this looks sparse here, by itself with so few posts since 2014, and you'd be correct.

The truth is, I've been blogging primarily on Jemurai.com.  I even threw away 80% 
of the blog posts there before 2016 when we moved that site to Wordpress.

What motivated me to pick back up on my personal blog was that I realized there might be a usefulness 
to a reflective, meta blog about how the Jemurai business is going, what is working and what didn't, 
what I'm learning about business, etc.  I imagine that may transcend Jemurai itself.

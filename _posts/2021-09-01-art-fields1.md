## Starting Simple

This post illustrates a super simple piece that starts from a scratch
array of black pixels and then programmatically sets some of them,
kind of in a wave.  Honestly, I just liked the pattern and thought
it illustrated some neat things you could do within this construct.

## Fields

This was inspired by a painted work that I saw at a gallery
in Austin, TX.  It was more circular with dots that were circles
and which expanded and got smaller as you went in and out from
the center of the canvas.  Unfortunately, I can find neither
the name of the artist or the gallery - which since closed.

## Code

This is the code I used to create the image.  It is interesting how some parts of
the process require just tweaking things, like sizes, indexes, offsets.  In this
case the mods, sizes and colors were things I wanted to mess with as I ran this
for fun.

Enjoy!

```python
import numpy as np 
from PIL import Image 

size = 1024
square = np.empty([size, size, 3], dtype = np.uint8) 
color = np.array([255, 155, 0], dtype = np.uint8) # Orange
#color = np.array([255, 255, 255], dtype = np.uint8) # White
square.fill(18) # fill Black

def size_dot(colo, x, y, square, radius):
    for i in range (0,radius):
        for j in range (0,radius):
            xi = x + i
            yj = y + j
            if xi >= size:
                xi = size - 1
            if yj >= size:
                yj = size - 1
            square[xi,yj]=colo

for x in range(0, size): 
    for y in range(0, size): 
        if y % 25 == 0:
            if x % 10 == 0:
                square[x,y] = color 
                if y % 80 == 0:
                    for i in range (1,6):
                        size_dot(color, x+(i*10), y+(i*10), square, 6-i)
                        size_dot(color, x+(i*-10), y+(i*-10), square, 6-i)

                    size_dot(color, x,y,square,7)

i = Image.fromarray(square)
i.show()
```
